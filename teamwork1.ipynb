In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure.\n\nEnron was formed in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he developed a staff of executives that – by the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's Board of Directors and Audit Committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.\n\nEnron shareholders filed a 40 billion dollar lawsuit after the company's stock price, which achieved a high of US90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than 1 dollar by the end of November 2001. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's 63.4 billion dollars in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year.\n\nMany executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Project Goal**\n\nThe goal of this project is to use the Enron dataset to train our machine learning algorithm to detect the possiblity of fraud (identify person's of interest.) Since we know our persons of interest (POIs) in our dataset, we will be able to use supervised learning algorithms in constructing our POI identifier. This will be done by picking the features within our dataset that separate our POIs from our non-POIs best.\n\nWe will start out our analysis by answering some questions about our data. Then, we will explore our features further by visualizing any correlations/outliers. Next, we will transform/scale our features and select those that will be most useful in our POI identifier, engineering new features and adding them to the dataset if provided to be useful for our analysis. We will identify at least two algorithms that may be best suited for our particular set of data and test them, tuning our parameters until optimal performance is reached. In our final analysis, the algorithm we have fit will be validated using our training/testing data. Using performance metrics to evaluate our results, any problems will be addressed and motifications made. In our final thoughts, the performance of our final algorithm will be discussed.
